Matlab code for the Poincare reachability. 

This code was used to generate the results for the 2015 AAS conference and also extended for use in the submission to Acta Astronautica.

The results were used in the following places

There are several large files which are not tracked in `git`, instead these are backed up to Google Drive. 

Make sure you do not overwrite/delete files on Google drive, but rather only pull.
